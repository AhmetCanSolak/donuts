## What is "Donuts & Development?"

Donuts & Development is an intermediate/advanced place to dive deeper into programming concepts. We meet every week on **Thursdays from 2-3:30pm** and alternate between **Tutorials** on the _1st and 3rd Thursdays_ of the month and **Code and Tell** on the _2nd and 4th Thursdays_ of the month, in the China Basin conference room. Beginners are welcome to come learn advanced topics!

Both sessions are hands-on, interactive coding sessions where we all learn together!

### What happens during Tutorials?

In **Tutorials**, someone shares knowledge by leading a tutorial showcasing a useful computational skill, software package, or just a cool trick. Presentations could include:

*   Napari: a Qt- and VisPy-based ndarray visualization tool
*   Parallelizing Python with Multiprocessing
*   Unix-fu for streamlining your development

### What happens during Code and Tell?

In **Code and Tell**, someone presents code that they wrote and solicits feedback on implementation details, software design, and best practices. Questions can range from:

*   How can this code be more “Pythonic?”
*   Which unit testing library should I use?
*   What is a “mock” for testing?
*   How do classes in Python really work?
*   How could I make this code faster/better/parallelized?


### Who can attend?

All are welcome, regardless of programming experience, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.

### Will there be donuts?

Yes, there will be donuts from [Dynamo Donut](https://dynamodonut.com) :)

### Who can I ask for questions?

Email olga.botvinnik@czbiohub.org if you have any questions, comments, or concerns. Also check out the #cupcakes-and-coding Slack channel for updates, and ask in the #eng-support Slack channel for day-to-day questions and discussions about computational woes.
